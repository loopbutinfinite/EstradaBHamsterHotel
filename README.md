//Changes were made to reflect the feedback left from the peer review to get the website looking closer to the protoype. Also fixed bug with responsiveness in mobile that was mentioned in the peer review feedback.

//Hamster Hotel

//Description: Created a html website from a prototype. The website utilizes components from Bootstrap and includes css classes from Bootstrap's library to style the website. Semantic html tags are used for accessability purposes. The website also uses custom css classes that target and overwrites Bootstrap's preset css and overwrites it for styling. The website is made with responsiveness in mind for various devices (mobile(576px), tablet(768px), desktop) and calls upon Bootstrap's css classes that utilize breakpoints and hiding elements for device layout and styling purposes. Also, media queries are used that are activated once the website reaches the screen size condition and styles the website with custom css for better readability on smaller devices. 

//Peer Review (Darcy Rose) -

// things I like: good use of card in bootstrap to configure the paradise section and package sections. I appreciate the way you made the cards collapse for mobile. I also like the way got the amenities section to collapse proportionally to responsiveness. Also the appearance of the mobile reserve a room section is well-configured. I also like the way you positioned the logo in the navbar above the other link elements when it shrinks.

// areas of improvement: You did a really good job! With that said, here are some things I noticed. The cards in paradise and packages could benefit from a removed border. Could use the dosis font from google fonts to be closer in appearance. The awards are out of order in paradise section. The cards in Our Rooms expand a bit past the border on mobile, so that could use some TLC. Also the reserve buttons in the room section could be positioned in the bottom left corner to be closer to the mockup.

//final thoughts: Overall the website is very similar to the hotel mockup. You can really see the use of style elements that we've discussed in class, and they're used WELL. Kudos!
